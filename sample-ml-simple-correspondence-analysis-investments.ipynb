    "This use case shows an example of how to use Simple Correspondence Analysis (SCA), a non-supervised Machine Learning (ML) technique, to plot into a graph the categories of qualitative variables (doesn't work for quantitative variables), namely Profile (of the investor) - row variable - and Investment (predominant type) - column variable. These variables and their categories are displayed onto a contingency table, in a matrix format, that displays the multivariate frequency distribution of the variables' categories. We do not count the variables, we count each category, or class, inside each variable, and, ultimately, plot those on the perceptual map (graph). Client Profile variable has, as possible category classes: Agressive, Conservative or Moderate. While Investiment variable has, as possible category classes: Stocks, Bonds and Savings. The quantity of possible dimensions (axes) of the graph is calculated as m = min(I – 1, J – 1), being I and J the number of categories of the row and column variables. In our case, as we have 2 variables with 3 categories each, that would give us min((3-1),(3-1)) = 2. Therefore, we have a case with two dimensions, that is, with 2 eigenvalues, each one with a certain inertia, which is similar to the variance we had with Factorial Analysis, and thus represents the quantity of data distributed throughout each axis or dimension. The first dimension (or lambda 1), i.e., the X dimension, is the one with the most inertia of data represented, followed by the second dimension (or lambda 2), i.e., the Y dimension... and if there are more dimensions, the inertia drops even further. These are the dimensions (axes X and Y) of the perceptual map onto which each category \"dot\" will be plotted, according to their respective coordinates. The goal of this Analysis is to calculate these coordinates and finally be able to analyse if any of the row categories relates to any of the column categories, that is, if the variables are generically related and through which categories, specifically, that relation stands. The closer the categories are plotted, the closer they relate to each other, for each row and column variable. In this case, we'll have only the 2 axes X and Y (that's why it's a Simple Correspondence Analysis, and not Multiple) and 6 categories plotted at the graph, 3 for the row variable and 3 for the column variable. We wanna check if any of these relates to each other (always comparing correpondent pairs of categories, one from the row Dimension (X) and another from the column Dimension (Y))... we do not compare categories from the same dimension or axis. If Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is used (more than 2 lambdas), then we have more than 2 dimensions or variables, which is another use case at this same notebook project. The number of categories, for each dimension, could be any. For this example, we have only two dimensions or qualitative variables, with 3 categories each. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SCA method follows the sequence below:\n",
    "- create a contingency table (crostab) with the distribution of observed frequencies of categories of each variable\n",
    "- calculate and mount another table with the expected frequencies\n",
    "- calculate and mount another table with the residuals, then the standardized residuals, then the adjusted standardized residuals\n",
    "- calculate the Chi square statistic (partial and total)\n",
    "- calculate the p-value for the Chi square statistic, in order to check if there is a statistically significant association (dependency) between the two variables. If not, do not proceed, the correspondence analysis won't be possible. If the p-value is below .05 (5%), or any other significance alfa you decide, then the qualitative variables are statistically dependent on each other. This hypothesis test is done on the Chi square distribution. Then you may proceed to check, based on what specific categories - inside the variables, that dependency of the variables is sustained\n",
    "- to check what categories depend on each other, and therefore make the variables also dependent on each other, you now compare the adjusted standardized residuals, at the respective table. This hypothesis test, in turn, is done on a Z Standard Normal Distribution. For each pair of categories (one from each variable), you have that adjusted residual, and, if it's value is above 1.96 (the critical value for the hypothesis test, with a 5% significance value, at a Z Distribution), then those two categories relate to each other and, thus, contribute to the relation or dependency between their respective variables. If the variables depend on each other, it is because at least some of their categories also depend on each other. We wanna know which are those determinant categories\n",
    "- now, for actually calculating the coordinates and plot the perceptual map graph, we calculate the eigenvalues, by first calculating the Matrix A, then the Matrix W. For the Matrix W we calculate the Det(W – λ . I ) = 0 equation, and finally get the absolute lambdas, one per dimension. The sum of the lambdas (inertia) is the principal total inertia. Which can also be calculated from the total Chi square. We can also calculate the relative inertia, for each lambda or dimension (the ammount of data - variance - represented at each axis)\n",
    "- calculate the Mass of variables for the row variable (3 result values) and for the column variable (other 3 result variables). With these, mount the row Mass and column Mass Matrices\n",
    "- now, for each lambda, we calculate its singular value\n",
    "- calculate the eigenvectors for the column variable (v) and row variable (u)\n",
    "- finally, and based on the respective eigenvectors, calculate the coordinates X and Y of the column and row variables' categories, plotting these on the perceptual map graph, and analyse the distance between any near categories (always one category from a variable or dimension, and another category from another variable or dimension). The usefulness of such a graph is that we can see all categories from all dimensions, all at once, on one same graph... differently from the tables we had created so far\n",
    "- optionally, we can also calculate, for each observation, their average coordinates, based on the average point of their respective categories, and plot them at the perceptual map together with all categories.\n",
